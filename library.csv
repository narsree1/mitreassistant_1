Use Case Name,Description,Log Source,Mapped MITRE Tactic(s),Mapped MITRE Technique(s)
O365 Excessive SSO logon errors,"The following analytic detects accounts experiencing a high number of Single Sign-On (SSO) logon errors. It leverages data from the o365_management_activity dataset, focusing on failed user login attempts with SSO errors. This activity is significant as it may indicate brute-force attempts or the hijacking/reuse of SSO tokens. If confirmed malicious, attackers could potentially gain unauthorized access to user accounts, leading to data breaches, privilege escalation, or further lateral movement within the organization.",O365,Credential Access,Modify Authentication Process
Linux File Creation In Init Boot Directory,"The following analytic detects the creation of files in Linux init boot directories, which are used for automatic execution upon system startup. It leverages file system logs to identify new files in directories such as /etc/init.d/ and /etc/rc.d/. This activity is significant as it is a common persistence technique used by adversaries, malware authors, and red teamers. If confirmed malicious, this could allow an attacker to maintain persistence on the compromised host, potentially leading to further exploitation and unauthorized control over the system.",Linux,Persistence,RC Scripts
TOR Traffic,"The following analytic identifies allowed network traffic to The Onion Router (TOR), an anonymity network often exploited for malicious activities. It leverages data from Next Generation Firewalls, using the Network_Traffic data model to detect traffic where the application is TOR and the action is allowed. This activity is significant as TOR can be used to bypass conventional monitoring, facilitating hacking, data breaches, and illicit content dissemination. If confirmed malicious, this could lead to unauthorized access, data exfiltration, and severe compliance violations, compromising the integrity and security of the network.",Palo Alto FW,Command And Control,Proxy
Enumerate Users Local Group Using Telegram,"The following analytic detects a Telegram process enumerating all network users in a local group. It leverages EventCode 4798, which is generated when a process enumerates a user's security-enabled local groups on a computer or device. This activity is significant as it may indicate an attempt to gather information on user accounts, a common precursor to further malicious actions. If confirmed malicious, this behavior could allow an attacker to map out user accounts, potentially leading to privilege escalation or lateral movement within the network.",Windows,"	Discovery",Account Discovery

Azure AD User Consent Blocked for Risky Application,"The following analytic detects instances where Azure AD has blocked a user's attempt to grant consent to a risky or potentially malicious application. This detection leverages Azure AD audit logs, focusing on user consent actions and system-driven blocks. Monitoring these blocked consent attempts is crucial as it highlights potential threats early on, indicating that a user might be targeted or that malicious applications are attempting to infiltrate the organization. If confirmed malicious, this activity suggests that Azure's security measures successfully prevented a harmful application from accessing organizational data, warranting immediate investigation to understand the context and take preventive measures.",Azure AD,Credential Access,Steal Application Access Token
O365 Disable MFA,"The following analytic identifies instances where Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is disabled for a user within the Office 365 environment. It leverages O365 audit logs, specifically focusing on events related to MFA settings. Disabling MFA removes a critical security layer, making accounts more vulnerable to unauthorized access. If confirmed malicious, this activity could indicate an attacker attempting to maintain persistence or an insider threat, significantly increasing the risk of unauthorized access. Immediate investigation is required to validate the reason for disabling MFA, potentially re-enable it, and assess any other suspicious activities related to the affected account.",O365,Credential Access,Modify Authentication Process
Crowdstrike User Weak Password Policy,"The following analytic detects CrowdStrike alerts for weak password policy violations, identifying instances where passwords do not meet the required security standards. These alerts highlight potential vulnerabilities that could be exploited by attackers, emphasizing the need for stronger password practices. Addressing these alerts promptly helps to enhance overall security and protect sensitive information from unauthorized access",Crowdstrike,Credential Access,Brute Force
Cisco Secure Firewall - Malware File Downloaded,"The following analytic detects file downloads that were classified as malware by Cisco Secure Firewall Threat Defense. It relies on the SHA_Disposition field with a value of ""Malware"" and includes metadata such as file name, file_hash hash, and threat classification. This analytic is critical for surfacing file-based threats that are identified via Cisco's AMP or Threat Grid integrations. If confirmed malicious, this could indicate delivery of malware.",Cisco Secure Firewall,"Execution,Command And Control","Exploitation for Client Execution,Ingress Tool Transfer"
Detect Rare Executables,"The following analytic detects the execution of rare processes that appear only once across the network within a specified timeframe. It leverages data from Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) agents, focusing on process execution logs. This activity is significant for a SOC as it helps identify potentially malicious activities or unauthorized software, which could indicate a security breach or ongoing attack. If confirmed malicious, such rare processes could lead to data theft, privilege escalation, or complete system compromise, making early detection crucial for minimizing impact.",Windows ,Execution,User Execution
ESXi External Root Login Activity,"This detection identifies instances where the ESXi UI is accessed using the root account instead of a delegated administrative user. Direct root access to the UI bypasses role-based access controls and auditing practices, and may indicate risky behavior, misconfiguration, or unauthorized activity by a malicious actor using compromised credentials.",VMWare ESXi Syslog,Defense Evasion,Valid Accounts
Kubernetes Anomalous Inbound Outbound Network IO,"The following analytic identifies high inbound or outbound network I/O anomalies in Kubernetes containers. It leverages process metrics from an OTEL collector and Kubelet Stats Receiver, along with data from Splunk Observability Cloud. A lookup table with average and standard deviation values for network I/O is used to detect anomalies persisting over a 1-hour period. This activity is significant as it may indicate data exfiltration, command and control communication, or unauthorized data transfers. If confirmed malicious, it could lead to data breaches, service outages, financial losses, and reputational damage.",kubernetes_metrics,Execution,User Execution
